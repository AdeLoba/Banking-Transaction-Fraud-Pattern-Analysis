# Banking-Transaction-Fraud-Pattern-Analysis
A financial institution seeks to identify behavioral fraud patterns using analytical profiling instead of machine learning.

## Objectives
- Identify time-based fraud patterns
- Determine high-risk transaction ranges
- Measure financial exposure
- Develop rule-based fraud flags

## Dataset
🗂 Credit Card Fraud Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Key Findings
- Fraud peaks between 00:00–04:00
- High-value transactions (>€500) show elevated fraud rates
- Fraud represents ~0.17% of volume but disproportionate financial loss
- Combined amount + time rule significantly improves detection targeting

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Power BI
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing

## Business Impact
Provided actionable fraud rules and risk segmentation framework that can be implemented without advanced ML infrastructure.
